These lines of jQuery code dynamically reload parts of the HTML content for elements with the classes `.notificationsIcon` and `#notificationsModal`. Here's what each line does in detail:

### 1. **`$(".notificationsIcon").load(" .notificationsIcon > *");`**
   - **Selector**: Targets the element(s) with the class `notificationsIcon`.
   - **`.load()` Function**: Fetches HTML content from the current page (`""` implies the current URL).
   - **Selector Inside `.load()`**: Specifies that only the immediate child elements (`> *`) of `.notificationsIcon` should be loaded.

   **Result**: The child elements of `.notificationsIcon` are reloaded from the current page's content. This is typically used to refresh a specific part of the page without reloading the entire page.

### 2. **`$("#notificationsModal").load(" #notificationsModal > *");`**
   - **Selector**: Targets the element with the ID `notificationsModal`.
   - **`.load()` Function**: Again, fetches HTML content from the current page.
   - **Selector Inside `.load()`**: Specifies that only the immediate child elements (`> *`) of `#notificationsModal` should be loaded.

   **Result**: The child elements of `#notificationsModal` are reloaded from the current page's content.

### General Use Case
These lines are commonly used to update dynamic sections of a webpage, such as:
- A notifications icon (to display new notifications).
- A modal (to show updated content when opened).

**Note**: For these lines of code to work as intended:
- The server-side response should return the expected HTML structure for these elements.
- The current page should already have the target elements (`.notificationsIcon` and `#notificationsModal`) to fetch updated content from.

This technique avoids a full page reload and improves user experience by only refreshing specific parts of the page.
